# ackrep_ci_results_for_unittest
This branch includes some manually edited yaml files to test behavior of passing and fainling entities (and last passing states).
The data in this branch is arbitrary and does not reflect any passing or failing state of entities, it merely exists to test the correct display of different results on the web-interface.
